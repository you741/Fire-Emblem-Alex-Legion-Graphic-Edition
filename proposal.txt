The Final Project will be a spin-off of Fire Emblem. The game will use the same key features. The main "game" happens in each chapter, where the player versus the computer to complete some type of objective. The player will control characters, of which 2 are the main. The game ends when the player completes all the chapters, or when either of the 2 main characters dies. During each chapter, the player will use items, recruit characters, attack enemies, and move units to complete the objective. Characters from previous chapters move on to the next chapters, to incentivize strategy, tactics, and other game mechanics.
