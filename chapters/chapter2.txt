:You Zhou and his group of men now are heading towards the sacred isle. In order to get there, they must pass the heavily fortified Xela Region. Alex has set up great defenses to prevent anyone from passing to get the sacred isle.
BACKGROUND:images/backgrounds/XelaFortress.png
:The Xela region has many guards and armored knights, who will not allow anyone to even enter the fortress. Entrance to the fortress is required as the road to the Sacred Isle has too many mountains to go by foot, so to access the Sacred Isle, they must use the underground train in the Xela Fortress.

Yoyo:We should be getting close now.
CONDITION:Albert;
Albert:I see a lot of troops up ahead.
CONDITION:*End*
CONDITION:;Albert
Yoyo:Oh dang, it looks like a lot of enemies up ahead
CONDITION:*End*
*Player*:I can break through the defenses.
Yoyo:Okay.
:In the castle...
Stefano:Yum, my lunch looks good
:*Gets stolen*
Stefano:HEY YOU! GIVE ME BACK MY FOOD!
Brandon:Oh shoot, better run.
:Few minutes later
Brandon:I think I lost him!
Yoyo:Hey Brandon!
Brandon:Prince You! I have succesfully infiltrated this fortress by following a group of soldiers!
Yoyo:Good! Did you learn anything?
Brandon:Not really.
Stefano:THERE YOU ARE! GIVE ME MY FOOD!
Brandon:Oh snap.
Yoyo:Brandon why did you steal food? You can always ask me.
Brandon:I didn't think I would see you so soon.
Yoyo:Oh. Hey archer there, I apologize for my spy stealing your food, but uh, can you accept an apology?
Stefano:Hmph. I don't know, what do you have to offer?
Yoyo:We'll give you some food and also what my spy stole.
Stefano:WHOA! YOU HAVE NOODLES!? Okay, I owe you now.
*Player*:Hey you can use bows right?
Stefano:Um... yeah?
*Player*:Fight for us and we'll keep giving you food.
Stefano:That sounds like an okay deal. An archer like me is usually in the back lines anyway.
Henry:There he is!
Eric:Oh yay! We found him!
Kevin:Finally...
Yoyo:Henry! Eric! Kevin! Where have you guys been?
Henry:We were out collecting shrooms when the castle was invaded. When we got back we saw the destruction and had no choice but to escape.
Yoyo:I'm glad you guys are safe. Could you guys help us out a bit? We're going to have to defeat the fortress up ahead.
Brandon:Be careful guys. The Xela Fortress is quite fortified.
CONDITION:Gary;
Gary:Dw bros, i carry. [HEY YOU THERE! YEAH YOU PLAYER! Breaking the fourth wall again *kek* - this is why you keep me alive. Anyway, Brandon is a thief, Stefano is an archer, Henry is a mercenary, Eric is a priest and Kevin is a shaman. Thieves, priests and shamans are very weak to physical attacks so keep them away from the front lines. Archers should also be kept away from the front lines...]
Henry:Uh... okay?
CONDITION:*End*
*Player*:Okay guys... just do as I say and we should win.
Brandon:Oh yeah *Player*, I am a thief.
*Player*:So...
Brandon:I can steal stuff for you! But they have to be an enemy right next to me with less than or equal speed and they must also have a non-weapon. I can't steal weapons you know.
*Player*:Interesting... I might have you steal things for me.
Brandon:Just take a look at all the enemies and see which ones have non-weapons for me to steal! Oh yeah I have to have space in my inventory too, or I won't be able to steal.
CONDITION:Gary;
Gary:[remember max limit for items is 5]
CONDITION:*End*
Eric:Also if anyone gets injured, just have me heal them! You can also heal troops by having them stand on forts. They will get healed at the start of your turn if they're standing on one!
*Player*:Yes... you guys are valuable assets indeed.
Yoyo:Alright guys! Let's go! Have me seize the gate *Player*. Just get me to stand on it and I'll use my royal master key to get in!
